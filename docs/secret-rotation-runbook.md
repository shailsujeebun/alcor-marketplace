# Secret Rotation Runbook

## Scope

This runbook covers rotation for:

- `JWT_SECRET`
- `UPLOAD_GUEST_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Prerequisites

- Access to the production secret manager.
- Access to deployment pipeline for API rollout.
- Incident contact list for backend + DevOps on-call.

## Rotation Steps

1. Create new secrets in secret manager.
2. Ensure new values are high entropy:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: at least 32 chars.
   - `UPLOAD_GUEST_TOKEN_SECRET`: at least 32 chars and different from `JWT_SECRET`.
   - `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: at least 24 chars.
3. Update deployment environment variables for API.
4. Deploy API to staging and verify startup health.
5. Run auth smoke tests in staging:
   - login
   - token refresh
   - logout
   - upload flow
6. Promote the same secret set to production.
7. Deploy API to production.
8. Verify production health checks and auth/upload smoke tests.
9. Invalidate old sessions if rotating `JWT_SECRET`:
   - force re-authentication for all users.
10. Confirm no startup validation errors in logs.

## Rollback

1. Revert to previous secret versions in secret manager.
2. Redeploy API.
3. Re-run smoke tests.
4. Open an incident if rollback fails.

## Evidence to Store

- Deployment ID / commit SHA.
- Timestamp of secret version change.
- Smoke test results.
- Any session invalidation notice sent to users.

## Update - 2026-02-17 (Fix_download)
- Implemented Autoline-style template/runtime upgrades: configurable `dataSource`, `dependsOn`, `visibleIf`, `requiredIf`, `resetOnChange`, and template block attachments.
- Added reusable `engine_block`, category-level `hasEngine`, and inheritance/fallback rules so new subcategories keep full details instead of losing engine-related fields.
- Added persistent "create new option" flows and APIs for `brand`, `model`, `subcategory`, `country`, and `city`, so new values are saved once and reused by all users.
- Added options/cascade runtime behavior: parent-change child reset, dependency-based option loading, and dependency-state caching.
- Completed validation checks and build/test verification; local infrastructure (Postgres/Redis/MinIO) confirmed working for this flow.
